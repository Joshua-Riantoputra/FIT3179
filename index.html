  <h1>Funding for Research and Development in Australia</h1>
  <div class="pure-g">

    <div class="pure-u-3-4">
      <p>
        Australia is known for being a center for research and development, being the home of the prestigious Group of Eight, an organisation of Eight world class universities dedicated to furthering research for the world. This includes Monash University and Melbourne University in Victoria, The University of Adelaide in South Australia, The University of New South Wales and The University of Sydney in New South Wales, The University of Queensland, University of Western Australia, and The Australian National University in the Australian Capital Territory.
      </p>

  <h2>Government, University, and Business Expenditure by State</h2>

  <div class="pure-g">
    <div class="pure-u-1-8"></div>
    <div class="pure-u-3-4" id="choropleth_map"></div>
    <div class="pure-u-1-8"></div>

      <p>
        Use the "Select Category" dropdown menu to dynamically adjust which type of expenditure is being visualised,
        between government, university, and business spending. By default, government expenditure is visualised.
        Further, units provided are in thousands of Australian Dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond just universities, Australia boasts having a strong investment in research and development from 
        both the government and the private sector. 
        We see that New South Wales and Victoria are the top two states in terms of magnitude of expenditure,
        regardless of category.
        In order to investigate the relationship between expenditure in different categories, 
        we analyse 3 scatter plots, each displaying a relationship between 2 kinds of expenditure.
        The relationship appears to be the strongest between government spending and university spending,
        though more research would be necessary to make a rigorous conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following plots use a single point to represent expenditure in a field, across the three categories of government, university,
        and business expenditure. As a result, beside just displaying possible relationships, the plots allow fields with high expenditure 
        to be easily identified. In particular, biomedical science, engineering, and information technology stand out.

  <h2>Relationship Between Different Categories of Expenditure, by Field</h2>

  <h2>University Expenditure by Social-Economic Goal and State</h2>

        To further investigate factors related to research investment,
        a heat map is provided on the right, allowing a clear visualisation of how different social-economic goals of research are 
        funded by each state in Australia. Mouse over the marks to highlight them, and double click on the figure to reset.
      </p>
      <p>
        We see that the largest expenditure by social-economic purpose is held by New South Wales, in the field of medicine. 
        This is accordance with typical assumptions people may have, that working in the field of medicine often leads to high salaries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Curiously, the lowest expenditure by social-economic purpose is held by defence, specifically in the Northern Territory. 
        This contradicts conventional wisdom which asserts that people working in defence are typically rich. 
        There could be multiple ways to explain this data.
        However, to rigorously and scientifically validate causal claims, one would need to conduct double blind experiments with a control group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though it is not possible to conclude things definitely,
        being able to visualise the available data still provides a meaningful understanding, greater than just viewing the raw data 
        in table form. Hence, a final visualisation is provided to illustrate how universities in each state of Australia fund 
        different disciplines.
